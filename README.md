# MyToken

This Solidity program is a simple token contract that demonstrates the basic functionality of creating and managing a token on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description

This program is a token contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes functions to mint and burn tokens, as well as a mapping variable to keep track of token balances for each address.

## Getting Started

### Executing Program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

1. Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol).
2. Copy and paste the provided code into the file.
3. To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.
4. Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
5. Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the `mint` and `burn` functions. Provide the desired address and value as arguments when calling these functions to mint or burn tokens for a specific address.
